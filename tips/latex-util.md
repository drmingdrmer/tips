	- **What Is Installed**
		- TeX Live, which contains TeX, LaTeX, AMS-TeX, and virtually every TeX-related style file and font. TeX Live is maintained by TeX User Groups across the world. TeX Live is compiled from the same sources for all platforms: Macintosh, Windows, Linux, Unix.
		- MacTeX also installs the GUI programs TeXShop, LaTeXiT, TeX Live Utility, and BibDesk.
		- MacTeX installs Ghostscript, an open source version of Postscript. Two optional packages install libgs, the dynamical library for Ghostscript, and mutool, an extra tool. These tools are used by only one program in TeX Live, dvisvgm. So they are not installed by default, but can be obtained using the "custom install" option in MacTeX.
