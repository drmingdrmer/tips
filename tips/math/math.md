- hamilton's quaternions
  Hamilton defined a quaternion as **the quotient of two directed lines in tridimensional space; or, more generally, as the quotient of two vectors**. A quaternion can be represented as the sum of a scalar and a vector. It can also be represented as the product of its tensor and its versor.
